# react-native-native-navigation (r3n)
Very ambitious private project to create a better native navigation framework.

## Current state
Navigation works, the stack navigator has basic styling.

## Roadmap
This is now being used in an actual project, functionality is mostly added based on the requirements of that project.
I'll keep adding other functionality whenever possible!
